# funclib

Functional Library for C# that follows the Clojure idiom.

1. This style forces you to follow the Single Responsibility method.
2. lower case method name to make calling the functions
3. Upper case names for classes
4. list of functions
5. how to add your own functions.


# Functions

Each function has two different access methods.

The funclib.Core.First( method is the standard C# naming style:
```csharp
using funclib.Compoents.Core;
...

var mapVector = new Map().Invoke(new Inc(), new Vector().Invoke(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));
// => [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

The second and cleaner method is:
```csharp
using static funclib.Core;
...

var mapVector = Map(inc, Vector(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));
// => [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

From the example above there are a few things to note.

1. Using a C# 6 feature: `using static`. This feature allows you to remove a explicit reference to the type when invoking a static method.

2. The use of the lower case function name for `map`. To distinguish between the different functions and the instantiation of the
function's class, I choose to use lower case function name. I am still trying to figure out if using lower case for methods or I should
flip it to be upper case for methods and lower case for properties. If anyone has any suggests as to why please let me know.

3. The use of the capital name of `Inc`. Again this is to distinguish between a function and a property.

# Non-Pure methods
Non-Pure methods (methods that have side effects) should be suffixed with at http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/01c3/index.htm character.
